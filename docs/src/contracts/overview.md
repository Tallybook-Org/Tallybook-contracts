# Overview

## Dependency graph

`price_book` has no dependencies on the other contract. `statement_registry` depends
on `price_book`: `anchor()` makes two live cross-contract calls to
`price_book.version_at()` to check the period against the schedule in force. That
dependency is also a compile-time one — `statement_registry/src/price_book.rs` uses
`soroban_sdk::contractimport!` to pull in `price_book`'s compiled wasm, so
`price_book` has to build first. `price_book`'s own address is passed into
`statement_registry`'s constructor once, at deployment, and is immutable after that —
there is no setter, so a `statement_registry` instance can never be pointed at a
different price book after it goes live.

```text
price_book  ◀──────────────  statement_registry
 (no deps)      version_at()      (anchor)
```

## Multi-tenant by operator address

Neither contract has a notion of "the" operator. Every storage key that holds
operator data is keyed by the operator's `Address` — `Latest(Address)`,
`Version(Address, u32)`, and `Timeline(Address)` in `price_book`; `Seq(Address)`,
`Statement(Address, u64)`, `ConsumerIdx(Address, Address)`, and `Dispute(Address, u64)`
in `statement_registry`. One deployed instance of each contract serves every operator
who ever calls `publish()` or `anchor()` against it; each operator's history is fully
isolated from every other operator's by the address in the key. There's no
registration step and no allowlist — the first `publish()` call for a new operator
address is what creates that operator's history.

## What stays off-chain, and why

Metering — counting individual requests and pricing them — never touches either
contract. At $0.01 a request, that's a deliberate cost tradeoff, not a convenience
one: [the worked example's real measured fee](../protocol/worked-example.md#the-cost-of-anchoring)
for a single Soroban contract call on testnet was about $0.0362. Writing that once per
billing period, covering however many requests the period contains, is negligible
against revenue. Writing it once per request would have cost about $3,616 to bill
$1,000 of that same example month's usage — more than the revenue it would have
recorded. Everything that would require a per-request on-chain write — metering
itself, and the off-chain custody and sweeping of payment-channel commitments — stays
off-chain by design; see [How it works](../how-it-works.md) for what's built versus
planned.
