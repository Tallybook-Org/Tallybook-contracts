# Deploys price_book, then statement_registry (pointed at price_book's
# address), to Stellar mainnet (pubnet). Builds both contracts first.
#
# Neither contract in this repository has been audited. Read SECURITY.md
# before deploying this to a network that moves real funds.
#
# Required environment:
#   STELLAR_ACCOUNT  Signing/source account: an identity name from the
#                     `stellar keys` store (recommended — see `stellar keys
#                     add`/`stellar keys generate`), or a secret key / seed
#                     phrase you export into the environment yourself.
#                     NEVER pass a secret key as a script argument or
#                     hardcode one here — this script only ever reads it
#                     from the environment or the keys store.
#   ADMIN_ADDRESS     Public key (G...) to pass as `admin` to both
#                     constructors. Holds no power over operator data in
#                     either contract; it only exists as a documented rent
#                     payer. Can be the same address as STELLAR_ACCOUNT's,
#                     but is deliberately a separate variable since the
#                     signer and the admin need not be the same account.
#   STELLAR_RPC_URL   Mainnet has no default public RPC — set this to your
#                      own RPC provider's URL.
#                     https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/rpc/rpc-providers
#
# Optional environment:
#   CONFIRM=yes       Skip the interactive confirmation prompt (for
#                     scripted/CI use). Omit it to be asked to type "yes"
#                     before anything is signed and submitted.
#
# Usage:
#   STELLAR_ACCOUNT=alice ADMIN_ADDRESS=GABC... STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://... \
#     ./scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh
